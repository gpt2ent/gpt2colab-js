# gpt2colab-js
Make GPT-2 complete your text in Colab. Use fancy JS, instead of default ugly colab interface.
~~This is proof of concept for developers that want to create apps with graphics in Colab.~~

This is a branch with some extra scuffed JS that supports generating 10 samples per request. If you use this repo as a playground, this branch will likely be more useful.

"10 samples per request" is a hardcoded number and this won't be changed in this repo.
